# 🍕 Pizza-Factory-Co.

**Pizza-Factory-Co.** is a simple React.js application that simulates a pizza menu for a fictional restaurant. This project was created to **practice the fundamentals of React**, including components, props, conditional rendering, dynamic lists, and basic logic handling.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 **Dynamic Menu** – Displays a list of pizzas from a static dataset
- 🧩 **Component-Based Architecture** – Functional components like `Menu`, `Pizza`, `Footer`, and `Order`
- ❌ **Sold Out State** – Visually indicates when a pizza is no longer available
- ⏰ **Conditional Rendering by Time** – Footer displays different messages based on opening hours
- 💻 **Responsive Layout** _(basic styling applied via CSS)_

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Frontend framework
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Modern JS syntax
- **CSS** – Basic styling (see `index.css`)
- **JSX** – Templating within React components

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Reinforce understanding of:
  - React component structure
  - `props` and dynamic data rendering
  - Conditional rendering and list mapping
  - Basic date/time logic in the UI
- Build a lightweight UI without using advanced frameworks or routing

## ▲ Deploy to Vercel

This project is a **Create React App** and is ready to deploy as a static site.

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`

These are already configured in `vercel.json`, so Vercel should auto-pick them up.

### Steps

1. Push this repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. In Vercel, click **Add New → Project** and import the repo.
3. Deploy (no extra settings needed).

## 🧠 What I Learned

Structuring UI using reusable components

Mapping arrays to dynamically render content

Passing and destructuring props

Creating simple UI logic based on date/time

Handling static assets like images in React
